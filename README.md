# advanced-portfolio
## Description
A personal updated portfolio demonstrating a variety of the skillsets acquired since the beginning of the class. Calling from Github to retrieve the list of public pinned repos, details, and topics to dynamically create a timeline.

## Usage
You can access the app here [https://andrew.ronchetto.me](https://andrew.ronchetto.me).

## User Story
**AS A(N)** interested party<br>
I **WANT** learn more about you<br>
**SO THAT** I can connect with you

### Acceptance Criteria
* Updated portfolio featuring Project 1 and two exemplary homework assignments.
  1. Display your contact information. If you don't want to share your personal email or phone number, use a separate email that you will only use for coding, also known as a developer email, and/or a call forwarding service, such as [Google Voice](https://voice.google.com/).

  2. Have links to your GitHub profile and LinkedIn profile

  3. Have a link to a downloadable PDF of your resume

  4. Display at least 2 examples of student work from either deployed projects or homeworks. For each project, make sure you have the following:

	  * Project title

	  * Link to the deployed version

	  * Link to the GitHub repository

	  * Screenshot of the deployed application

  5. Have a polished, mobile-responsive user interface.

* Updated GitHub profile with pinned repositories featuring Project 1 and two exemplary assignments.

  1. Profile picture or avatar

  4. Link to your deployed portfolio

  5. At least 2 pinned repositories.

  6. Follow a few of your classmates and/or other developers. They are the beginning of your professional network and being a developer is as much about being a part of the community as it is writing code.
